# AURORA class

This class implement the base mechanism of AURORA. It must be used with an emitter. To get the usual AURORA algorithm, one must use the [mixing emitter](emitters.md#qdax.core.emitters.standard_emitters.MixingEmitter).

The AURORA class can be used with other emitters to create variants, like [PGA-AURORA](pga_aurora.md).
