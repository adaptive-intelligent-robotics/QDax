# Installation

## Setting up the environment
There are two options for installing the dependencies using either `docker` or `conda` depending on your preference.

=== "Docker"

    **Using docker :material-docker:**

    If it is not already done, install docker. Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to install it on Ubuntu.

    Steps to build your docker image:

    - Build the dev-image in `dev.Dockerfile`

    ```
    sudo docker build --target dev-image -t instadeep/qdax:$USER -f dev.dockerfile .
    ```

    !!! hint "Save time: use the Makefile"
        The command `make build` automatically builds the container.

    - Setup your image, mount your directory and start developing

    To develop code in your IDE while running it inside your container, mount this folder into your container. For example, you might first get the path to your QDax root folder inside an environment variable:

    ```
    cd ..
    export QDAX_PATH=$(pwd)
    ```

    and then mount QDax into your container:

    ```
    cd docker
    sudo docker run --rm -it -v $QDAX_PATH:/app instadeep/qdax:$USER /bin/bash
    ```

    !!! hint "Save time: use the Makefile"
        The command `make dev_container` automatically runs the image, mounts the qdax directory, setups the GPU and forwards Neptune's credentials. Pretty handy, right?


    ??? question "How to use GPUs with Docker?"

        Docker also allows you to use GPUs. First, be sure you have already installed
        the Nvidia drivers on your computer and that you have installed
        [nvidia-docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).
        Then, to use all your GPUs inside docker run:

        ```
        sudo docker run --rm -it --gpus all -v $QDAX_PATH:/app instadeep/qdax:$USER /bin/bash
        ```

        If you want to use only a subset of the available GPUs inside docker (for instance only GPUs with ID 0 and 1), run:

        ```
        sudo docker run --rm -it --gpus '"device=0,1"' -v $QDAX_PATH:/app instadeep/qdax:$USER /bin/bash
        ```

=== "Singularity"

    **Using singularity :man_technologist:**

    First, follow these initial steps:

    1. If it is not already done, install Singularity, following [these instructions](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html).

    2. Clone `qdax`
    ```zsh
    git clone git@github.com:adaptive-intelligent-robotics/QDax.git
    ```

    3. Enter the singularity folder
    ```zsh
    cd qdax/singularity/
    ```

    You can build two distinct types of images with singularity: "final images" or "sandbox images".
    A final image is a single file with the `.sif` extension, it is immutable.
    On the contrary, a sandbox image is not a file but a folder, it allows you to develop inside the singularity container to test your code while writing it.

    To build a final image, execute the `build_final_image` script:
    ```zsh
    ./build_final_image
    ```
    It will generate a `.sif` file: `[image_name].sif`. If you execute this file using singularity, as follows, it will run the default application of the image, defined in the `singularity.def` file that you can find in the `singularity` folder as well. At the moment, this is just running the MAP-Elites algorithm on a simple task.
    ```zsh
    singularity run --nv [image_name].sif
    ```

    !!! warning "Using GPU"
        The `--nv` flag of the `singularity run` command allows the container to use the GPU, it is thus important to use it for QDax.


    To build a sandbox image, execute the `start_container` script:
    ```zsh
    ./start_container -n
    ```

    !!! warning "Using GPU"
        The `-n` flag of the `start_container` command allow the container to use the GPU, it is thus important to use it for QDax.

    This command will generate a sandbox container `qdax.sif/` and enter it. If you execute this command again later, it will not generate a new container but enter directly the existing one.
    Once inside the sandbox container, enter the qdax development folder:
    ```zsh
    cd /git/exp/qdax
    ```
    This folder is linked with the `qdax` folder on your machine, meaning that any modification inside the container will directly modify the files on your machine. You can now use this development environment to develop your own QDax-based code.


=== "Conda"

    **Using conda :man_technologist:**

    1. If it is not already done, install conda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)

    2. Install some necessary packages on your machine
    ```zsh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
                        ffmpeg \
                        libgl1-mesa-dev \
                        libgl1-mesa-glx \
                        libglfw3 \
                        libosmesa6-dev \
                        patchelf \

    ```

    1. Clone `qdax`
    ```zsh
    git clone git@github.com:adaptive-intelligent-robotics/QDax.git
    ```

    1. Create a conda environment with all required libraries
        ```zsh
        cd QDax
        conda env create -f environment.yaml
        ```

    2. Activate the environment and manually install the package qdax
        ```zsh
        conda activate qdaxpy38
        pip install -e .
        ```

    !!! warning "Install GPU support"
        This tutorial only covers the installation on a CPU hardware. If you wish to run the
        code on GPU, consider using the docker tutorial. You can also install cuda on your
        machine and follow the instructions to setup jax on GPU from
        [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).
