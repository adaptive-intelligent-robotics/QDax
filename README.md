# QDax: Accelerated Quality-Diversity
QDax is a tool to accelerate Quality-Diveristy (QD) and neuro-evolution algorithms through hardware accelerators and massive parallelism. QDax has been developped as a research framework: it is flexible and easy to extend.

## Hands on QDax
[![Open All Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/instadeepai/QDax/blob/2-instadeep-new-structure-suggestion/)

To see how QDax works, you can run this [notebook](./notebooks/mapelites_example.ipynb) on colab, it is an example of MAP-Elites evolving a population of controllers on a chosen Brax environment (Walker by default).

## Installation

The simplest way to install QDax is to clone the repo and to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/QDax.git
cd QDax
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Nevertheless, we recommand to use either Docker, Singularity or conda to use the repository. Steps to do so are presented in the [documentation](https://qdax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/).

## Current components of QDax

### Algorithms
- MAP-Elites
- CVT MAP-Elites
- Policy Gradient Assisted MAP-Elites

### Tasks and environments
- Brax environments with wrappers to access feet contact and xy position of the agent in the environment.
- AntTrap
- AntMaze
- PointMaze

## QDax flexibility

QDax has been designed to be flexible so it's easy for anyone to extend it. For instance, MAP-Elites is designed to work with many different components: a user can hence create a new emitter and pass it to the MAPElites class without having to re-implement everything.
